What are Difference between Connection and Adaptor?</code></pre> <p>Ans: Connection is the Starting Point before creating any integration. This is the Place where you specify whether it is an Invoke or Trigger or Both. Connection Always Leverages an Adaptor; it could be an Application Specific or Technology Adaptor. For Instance, ERP cloud, Sales force, Workday adaptors are Application Specific whereas FTP, REST, SOAP are Technology Adaptors.</p> <pre><code>6. What are Different Types of Integrations are Available?</code></pre> <p>Ans: App Driven Orchestration, Scheduled Orchestration, File Transfer, Basic Routing, Publish to OIC, Subscribe to OIC</p> <pre><code>7. What is a package in the OIC?</code></pre> <p>Ans: Packages gives a convenient way to Group Similar kind of Integrations into one Package. This is very help full at the time of deployment. Instead of individual integrations deployment, we can simply deploy the respective package to target instance. </p> <pre><code>8. What are Different Integration Actions available?</code></pre> <p>Ans: Using integration actions, you can view, Edit, Clone, and Create new Version, Update Property Values, Export, API Management, Insight Designer, Tracing, Configure</p> <pre><code>9. What is the use of Update Property value Action?</code></pre> <p>Ans: This Action gives the developer an ability to update the design time values outside of the integration. For Instance, In an Email notification activity, you specify an email address to use in the \"To\" Field during run time which overrides the email address at the design-time. To put it Simply, This option enables you to configure the value without editing the integration design.</p> <pre><code>10. What is the Maximum integration properties can be added?</code></pre> <p>Ans: 10 </p> <pre><code>11. In which state the Integration has to be in order to update the properties?</code></pre> <p>Ans: App Driven Orchestration has to be in configured state to update Properties whereas Scheduled Integration supports even if it the integration is active.</p> <pre><code>12. What are Agents?</code></pre> <p>Ans: When you need to integrate with an application behind firewall, you need to configure the agent on the Server where the application is installed .OIC Connectivity agent registers with oracle integration over SSL using the provided oracle integration credentials.</p> <pre><code>13. What are OIC Lookups?</code></pre> <p>Ans: Lookups help you to configure the static values and use them at run time, eliminates the need of hardcoding the same at the mapping level.</p> <pre><code>14.
