This function would be a part of the SOAP body.</p> <p>REST is a data-driven architecture, whereas SOAP is a standard protocol for transmitting structured data that is more function-driven. Unlike SOAP, which only allows the use of XML, REST allows the use of a wide variety of data types, including plain text, HTML, XML, and JSON.

What is Opaque Schema?","text":"<p>No need to worry about the file\u2019s schema while performing Read File or Write File operations with an opaque schema. This is the only requirement: Base64-encoded data should be available to the opaque element. The Opaque schema is needed in OIC especially when you need to write a Bse64-encoded data using stage file to extract it into a structured variable. For example, when BIP report is run using Report Service in OIC the response will be always in Base64-encoded data. In order to extract that report response into a structured variable, which will enable to refer the individual elements there is a need to write it using stage file and read back using sample data as per the requirement. The stage file write operation does not have an option to write without structure, in that case Opaque schema can be used.</p>"},{"location":"oic/oic-interview-questions/#22-what-is-ical-expression","title":"22.
