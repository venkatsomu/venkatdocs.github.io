# OIC Naming Standards

Naming standards in Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) are essential for maintaining consistency and organization within your integration projects. While there might not be an official standard that applies universally, here are some common best practices and guidelines you can follow when naming artifacts and components within Oracle Integration Cloud:

###  ^^Project Names^^:
Use descriptive and meaningful names that reflect the purpose or business context of the project.
Avoid using spaces or special characters. Use underscores or hyphens for word separation.
Keep project names concise but informative.
Example: OrderProcessingIntegration

###  ^^Integration Names^^:
Start with a verb that represents the action being performed.
Use CamelCase or underscores to separate words.
Include the source and target systems or applications in the integration name.
Example: ProcessOrderFromERPToCRM

###  ^^Connection Names^^:
Include the type of connection (e.g., REST, SOAP, Database) and the name of the connected system.
Use CamelCase or underscores to separate words.
Example: ERP_RESTConnection

###  ^^Integration Interface Names^^:
Use descriptive names that convey the purpose and direction of the interface (inbound or outbound).
Include the application or system names involved in the interface.
Use CamelCase or underscores to separate words.
Example: Inbound_OrderFromERP

###  ^^Mappings and Transformations^^:
Use names that indicate the purpose of the mapping or transformation.
Include source and target objects/entities in the name.
Use CamelCase or underscores to separate words.
Example: Map_OrderToCustomerObject

###  ^^Lookups and Reference Tables^^:
Name lookups or reference tables based on the data they hold or the purpose they serve.
Include a brief description if necessary.
Use CamelCase or underscores to separate words.
Example: CountryCodeLookup

###  ^^Error Handling Artifacts^^:
Use names that reflect the type of error or the situation being handled.
Include the context or integration involved.
Use CamelCase or underscores to separate words.
Example: OrderProcessing_ErrorHandler

###  ^^Tracking and Monitoring Artifacts^^:
Include the type of monitoring or tracking being performed.
Add relevant context or integration details.
Use CamelCase or underscores to separate words.
Example: OrderTracking_Monitoring

Remember, the key is to create descriptive, meaningful, and easy-to-understand names for both the developers working on the integration and other stakeholders. These guidelines help you maintain a clear and organized structure within your Oracle Integration Cloud projects.
